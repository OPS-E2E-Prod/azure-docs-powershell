> [!NOTE]
> 
> After November 2018, there will be no new features or cmdlets added to the `AzureRM` module. `AzureRM` will continue to be supported and
> receive bugfixes. New features will be provided in the `Az` module, which will reach 1.0 at the same time. `Az` has a backwards compatibility
> mode with `AzureRM`, and is designed to be easy to switch to. To learn more about this new module and how to upgrade, see:

> * [Install Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
> * [Migrate to the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/migrate-from-azurerm-to-az)
>
> If you have deployments that use the classic deployment model that cannot be converted,
> you can install the Service Management version of Azure PowerShell. For more information, see
> [Install the Azure PowerShell Service Management module](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps).
