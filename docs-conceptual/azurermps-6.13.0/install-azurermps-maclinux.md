# Install Azure PowerShell on macOS or Linux

For non-Windows platforms, it's possible to run Azure PowerShell in PowerShell Core v6. This version of PowerShell
is built for use on any platform that supports .NET Core. To work with these platforms, there's a .NET Standard
version of Azure PowerShell available.

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, Azure PowerShell for .NET Standard is still in beta.
> If you have problems or discover bugs, please file an issue on GitHub.

## Install PowerShell Core

The installation instructions for PowerShell Core are different for macOS and most Linux distributions.
Detailed instructions can be found in the following articles:

* [Install PowerShell Core on macOS](/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-macos)
* [Install PowerShell Core on Linux](/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-linux)

## Install Azure PowerShell for .NET Standard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `AzureRM` module detailed in other articles does not work with PowerShell Core.
> You must install the `Az` module to get Azure PowerShell functionality in PowerShell Core.

PowerShell Core comes with the PowerShellGet module already installed. Start PowerShell with the command:

```bash
pwsh
```

To install Azure PowerShell, run the following command:

```powershell-interactive
Install-Module Az
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter a permissions error when attempting to install the module, you may need to run
> PowerShell in superuser mode to install modules.
>
> ```bash
> sudo pwsh
> ```

By default, the PowerShell gallery isn't configured as a trusted repository for PowerShellGet. The
first time you use the PSGallery you see the following prompt:

```output
Untrusted repository

You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change
its InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet.

Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
```

Answer `Yes` or `Yes to All` to continue with the installation.

## Enable aliases

For compatibility with the existing `AzureRM` module, the new `Az` module has the ability to create backwards compatible
aliases for the `AzureRM` cmdlets. Before using the module for the first time, set up these aliases with the following command:

```powershell-interactive
# Import the module into the PowerShell session
Import-Module Az
# Enable AzureRM aliases for the user
Enable-AzureRmAlias -Scope CurrentUser
```

This sets up aliases for the current user only. Check the cmdlet help for other values that can be provided to `-Scope` to
set up the aliases.

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter an error about a path location, make sure that it exists on your local system. For the `CurrentUser` scope,
> this error can be resolved by running the following command in `bash`:
>
> ```bash
> mkdir -p $HOME/.config/powershell
> ```

## Sign in

To start working with Azure PowerShell, you need to load `Az` into your PowerShell session
with the [Import-Module](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Import-Module) cmdlet, and then sign in
with your Azure credentials. Importing a module does __not__ require elevated privileges.

```powershell-interactive
# Import the module into the PowerShell session
Import-Module Az
# Connect to Azure with an interactive dialog for sign-in
Connect-AzureRmAccount
```

You'll need to repeat these steps for every new PowerShell session you start. Automatically importing the `Az` module requires
setting up a PowerShell profile, which you can learn about in [About Profiles](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles).
On macOS and Linux, you should work with your profile through the `$Profile` environment variable. To learn how to persist your Azure sign-in across sessions,
see [Persist user credentials across PowerShell sessions](context-persistence.md).
