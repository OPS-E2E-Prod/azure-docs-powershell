# Migrate from AzureRM to Azure PowerShell Az

The Az module has feature parity with AzureRM, but uses shorter and more consistent cmdlet names.
Scripts written for the AzureRM cmdlets won't automatically work with the new
module. To make the transition easier, Az offers tools to allow you to run your existing scripts
using AzureRM. No migration to a new command set is ever convenient, but this article will help
you get started on transitioning to the new module.

## Ensure your existing scripts work with the latest AzureRM release

This is the most important step! Run your existing scripts, and make sure that they work with the
_latest_ release of AzureRM (__6.13.0__). If your scripts don't work, make sure to read
the [AzureRM migration guide](migration-guide.6.0.0.md).

## Install the Azure PowerShell Az module

The first step is to install the Az module on your platform. To install Az, you need to uninstall AzureRM.
In the following steps, you'll learn how to keep running your existing scripts and enable compatibility
for old cmdlet names.

To install the Azure PowerShell Az module, follow these steps:

* [Uninstall the AzureRM module](uninstall-azurerm-ps.md). Make sure that you remove _all_ installed versions of AzureRM, not just the most recent version.
* [Install the Az module](install-az-ps.md)

## <a name="aliases"/>Enable AzureRM alias mode

With AzureRM uninstalled and your scripts working with the latest AzureRM version, now is the time to
enable the compatibility mode for the Az module. Compatibility is enabled with the command:

```powershell-interactive
Enable-AzureRmAlias -Scope CurrentUser
```

Aliases enable the ability to use old cmdlet names with the `Az` module installed. These
aliases are written to the user profile for the selected scope. If no user profile exists, one is created.

> [!WARNING]
>
> You can use a different `-Scope` for this command, but it's not recommended! Aliases are written to
> the user profile for the selected scope, so keep enabling them to as limited a scope as possible. Enabling aliases
> system-wide could also cause issues for other users which have `AzureRM` installed in their local scope.

Once the alias mode is enabled, run your scripts again to confirm that they still function as expected. 

## Change module imports and cmdlet names

In general, the module names have been changed so that `AzureRM` and `Azure` become `Az`, and the same for cmdlets.
For example, the `AzureRM.Compute` module has been renamed to `Az.Compute`. `New-AzureRmVM` has become `New-AzVM`,
and `Get-AzureStorageBlob` is now `Get-AzStorageBlob`.

There are exceptions to this naming change that you should be aware of before doing any renaming:

| AzureRM module | Az module |
|----------------|-----------|
| AzureRM.DataFactories | Az.DataFactory |
| AzureRM.DataFactoryV2 | Az.DataFactory |
| AzureRM.RecoveryServices.Backup | Az.RecoveryServices |
| AzureRM.RecoveryServices.SiteRecovery | Az.RecoveryServices |

## Summary

By following these steps, you can update all of your existing scripts to use the new module. If you have any questions or problems with these steps that made your migration difficult, please comment on this article so that we can improve the instructions.
